# ActiveRecord Migration Constraints and Model Validations

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository, then bundle install.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- Explain the relationship between constraints and validations
- Use constraints to help enforce data integrity
- Use validations to help enforce data integrity

## Introduction

A company's data can sometimes be its most valuable asset, even more so than code or employees. There are several different places where data integrity can be maintained within an application, including:
* within the database itself
* on the client-side (implemented in JavaScript)
* in the controllers

However, each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages.

| Location | Pro     | Con     |
| :------- | :------ | :------ |
| Database | Useful if multiple apps use the same DB. Sometimes faster than other approaches. | Implementation depends on the specific DB you use. |
| Client | Independent of our back-end Implementation. Quick feedback for users. | Unreliable on its own, and can be circumvented. |
| Controller | Within the app, so it can't be circumvented. In Ruby, so independent of our DB choice. | Difficult to test and maintain. Controllers should be sparse! |

Rails's perspective is that the best places for dealing with data integrity are in migrations and in the model, since they have all of the advantages of controller validation but none of the disadvantages.

> Except strong parameters - as you know, that kind of validation is conventionally done in the controller.

Let's look at some ways ActiveRecord helps us to maintain data integrity.

## Migration Constraints

A **constraint**, sometimes called a _table constraint_ or _columnconstraint_, is a restriction on the data allowed in a table column or columns. We've already seen a few of these in previous projects' migration files:

```ruby
class CreateCountries < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :countries do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :population
      t.string :language

      t.timestamps null: false # `null: false` is a constraint
    end
  end
end

```

Different SQL implementations feature a wide variety of constraints that they can use; ActiveRecord supports some of these, but not all. The most important ones that it _does_ support are:

* **`null: false`**

  Equivalent to the `NOT NULL` constraint in SQL. This prevents the database from saving a row without a value in that particular column into the database.

  **EXAMPLE :**
  Suppose I want to ensure that every country entered has a name - blank names are forbidden. In the migration file for Countries, I can write:
  ```ruby
  class CreateCountries < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :countries do |t|
        t.string :name, null: false       # added ', null: false'
        t.integer :population
        t.string :language

        t.timestamps null: false
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  If I run this migation, and then open up the Rails Console, I find that I am unable to `create` new Countries without specifying names for them.

* **`unique: true` / `index: {unique: true}`**

  A uniqueness constraint. This can be used to define a single column as having only unique values, or to specify that certain _combinations of column values_ must be unique.

  **EXAMPLE :**
  Consider a second model, Person. Suppose I want to ensure that each person has a unique phone number, and a unique full name (`given_name` + `surname`); I might make the following change to the `CreatePeople` migration.
  ```ruby
  class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :people do |t|
        t.string :given_name
        t.string :surname
        t.string :phone_number

        t.timestamps null: false
      end

      add_index :people, :phone_number, unique: true
      add_index :people, [:given_name, :surname], unique: true
    end
  end
  ```

  _**Be careful**: a `NULL` value never equals anything, including itself, so `NULL` values are always unique. This is sometimes desirable, but in most cases we'll also want the `null:false` option._

  > ##### NOTEWORTHY ASIDE
  >
  > Though it's not a constraint, you should know that `index: <hash>` passes on any parameters given in the hash to the `add_index` method.
  >
  ```ruby
  add_column :people, :phone_number, :string, index: {unique: true}
  # Above and below are equivalent.
  add_column :people, :phone_number, :string
  add_index :people, :phone_number, unique: true
  ```
  > You may also see `index: true` in an add_reference method; in that context, `index: true` is telling Rails to create a new index column and to make that the reference.

* **`foreign_key: true` / `references: {foreign_key: true}`**

  A referential constraint, requiring that a row in a "child" table have a matching identifier in the "parent" table.

  _As with the uniqueness constraint, this doesn't prevent null values in the referring column, so we'll usually want to include the `null:false` option._

  **EXAMPLE :**
  Now that we have 'Country' and 'Person' resources, suppose we want to link them together through a third resource called 'Citizenship'. I run `rails g model Citizenship status:string date_obtained:date`, which builds a new model and migration file.
  I can then create two new empty migrations to link all the tables together.
  ```ruby
  class AddPeopleToCitizenships < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      add_reference :citizenships, :person, index: true, foreign_key: true
    end
  end
  ```
  ```ruby
  class AddCountriesToCitizenships < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      add_reference :citizenships, :country, index: true, foreign_key: true
    end
  end
  ```
  >If the '...\_id' column was already added by a previous migration, I could use `add_foreign_key` method instead of `add_reference` to add the foreign key constraint to an existing column.

  Once I add the appropriate methods to the models, I can test it in the Rails Console.
  ```ruby
  class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :citizenships
    has_many :people, through: :citizenships
  end
  ```
  ```ruby
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :citizenships
    has_many :countries, through: :citizenships
  end
  ```
  ```ruby
  class Citizenship < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :country
    belongs_to :person
  end
  ```

### We Do :: ActiveRecord Constraints

In your groups, follow the example above and create three new resources that have a `has_many ... , through ... ` relationship, and add non-null, uniqueness, and foreign key constraints to all three via the migration files.

### You Do :: ActiveRecord Constraints

Individually, create two new resources in the same application with a `has_many`/`belongs_to` relationship.

## Model Validations

ActiveRecord::Base provides **validator** methods that allow us to perform checks on model properties. For certain model methods (`create`, `create!`, `save`, `save!`, `update`, `update!`), if any requested check fails, the model cannot be saved.  There are many more model validation methods than there are ways to set constraints in migration files, so you'll often see more validation done in models than in migrations.

Let's look at how we might validate the same three things we wanted to validate above: empty values, uniqueness, and references.

* **Empty Values**

  To prevent empty values we'll use `validates <property>, presence: true`. This is a slightly more restrictive check than `null: false`, it disallows both empty values, `nil` in ruby and `NULL` in the database, and it also disallows empty strings (for string properties).

  **EXAMPLE :**
  To set an empty-value validator in our Country model, I might write
  ```ruby
  class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :citizenships
    has_many :people, through: :citizenships

    validates :name, presence: true
  end
  ```

* **Uniqueness**

  To ensure that a property is unique, we'll use `validates <property>, uniqueness: true`.  If this is a multi-column uniqueness check, we replace the boolean with a hash providing a scope for the uniqueness check, e.g. `{scope: <other property>}`.

  **EXAMPLE :**
  To set some uniqueness validators in my Person model, I might write
  ```ruby
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :citizenships
    has_many :countries, through: :citizenships

    validates :phone_number, uniqueness: true
    validates :given_name, uniqueness: {scope: :surname}
    validates :surname, uniqueness: {scope: :given_name}
  end
  ```

* **References**

  For referential integrity checks, we'll use `validates <model>, presence: true`, where `<model>` is the symbol we passed to `belongs_to`.

  **EXAMPLE :**
  I want to test that a Citizenship instance refers to an instance of Country and an instance of Person. I might write the following:
  ```ruby
  class Citizenship < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :country
    belongs_to :person

    validates :country, presence: true
    validates :person, presence: true
  end
  ```

ActiveRecord::Base comes with a slew of other validators we can use, as well as the mechanisms to create our own custom validators.
